Privacy Policy

Last updated: May 5, 2025

This application is a self-hosted, privately used instance of n8n, an automation platform. It is not intended for public use, and no personal data is collected, stored, or shared outside of the user's own infrastructure.

1. Data Collection
This application does not collect or transmit any personal data to third parties. All workflows and data remain within the local environment under the user's full control.

2. Use of Google APIs
This application uses the Google API only to access services such as Google Sheets on behalf of the authenticated user. The data retrieved is used solely to execute user-defined automation workflows.

3. Data Storage
All data used by this application is stored locally on the self-hosted server. No data is sent to or stored on external servers managed by the application developer.

4. Data Sharing
No user data is shared with third parties. OAuth tokens and credentials are stored securely within the local environment.

5. Security
Reasonable steps are taken to protect stored data, including the use of local encryption mechanisms and access controls within n8n.

6. User Responsibility
Since this application is privately deployed and managed, the user is responsible for maintaining security and privacy of their own data.

7. Contact
If you have any questions, contact the system administrator managing your local instance.
